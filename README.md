# Poisson Process

# Aim : 
To find the probability of that  (i) exactly 4 customers arrive (ii) more than 4 customers arrive (iii) fewer than 4 customers in 2 minute  arrival. Given that the customers arrive at a bank according to a Poisson process with mean rate of 3 per minute  during a time interval of 2 min. 


# Software required :  

Python

# Theory:

The Poisson process is one of the most widely-used counting processes. It is usually used in scenarios where we are counting the occurrences of certain events that appear to happen at a certain rate, but completely at random (without a certain structure). For example, suppose that from historical data, we know that earthquakes occur in a certain area with a rate of 2 per month. Other than this information, the timings of earthquakes seem to be completely random. Thus, we conclude that the Poisson process might be a good model for earthquakes. In practice, the Poisson process or its extensions have been used to model.

Thus, the program to find the probability of the given conditions using Poisson process is implemented.
